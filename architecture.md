 **full developer-level detailed architecture** for **PolkaComputeLab**. I’ll break it into **runtime, pallets, storage, extrinsics, OCWs, consensus manager hooks, telemetry, and cross-chain flow**. This will essentially serve as a **blueprint for coding in Rust/Substrate**.

## **2. Pallet-Level Architecture**

### **2.1 Job Registry Pallet**

**Purpose:** Register jobs, track metadata, dependencies, and status.

* **Storage:**

```rust
JobId -> JobStruct {
    owner: AccountId,
    metadata: Vec<u8>,
    dependencies: Vec<JobId>,
    deadline: BlockNumber,
    status: JobStatus, // Pending/InProgress/Verified/Failed
}
```

* **Extrinsics:**

```rust
submit_job(metadata, dependencies, deadline)
update_job_status(job_id, status)
```

* **Events:**

* `JobSubmitted(JobId)`

* `JobStatusUpdated(JobId, JobStatus)`

* **Logic:**

  * Prevent circular dependencies.
  * Allow querying pending jobs for OCWs.

---

### **2.2 Job Verifier Pallet**

**Purpose:** Verify off-chain job results submitted by OCWs.

* **Storage:**

```rust
JobId -> ResultHash
JobId -> Verified(bool)
```

* **Extrinsics:**

```rust
submit_proof(job_id, result_hash, signature)
mark_verified(job_id)
```

* **Logic:**

  * Verify proof signatures or Merkle proofs.
  * Update JobRegistry status.
  * Emit verification events for telemetry.

---

### **2.3 Consensus Manager Pallet**

**Purpose:** Dynamically change consensus and record metrics.

* **Storage:**

```rust
ConsensusType // Aura/BABE/Custom
BlockMetrics { block_number, validator_set, block_time, forks }
```

* **Extrinsics:**

```rust
set_consensus(consensus_type)
get_metrics(block_number)
```

* **Logic:**

  * Runtime hooks listen for `on_initialize` & `on_finalize`.
  * Switch consensus safely at block boundaries.
  * Notify telemetry pallet of changes & metrics.

---

### **2.4 Event Hub Pallet**

**Purpose:** Trigger jobs or actions from events (on-chain or XCMP).

* **Storage:**

```rust
EventId -> EventData
EventId -> TriggerRules
```

* **Extrinsics:**

```rust
submit_event(event_data)
register_trigger(event_id, action)
```

* **Logic:**

  * Validates event proofs for cross-chain triggers.
  * Pushes events to OCWs for execution.
  * Optionally triggers dependent jobs.

---

### **2.5 Telemetry Pallet**

**Purpose:** Collect and expose metrics for job execution & consensus performance.

* **Storage:**

```rust
JobMetrics { job_id, start_time, end_time, status }
ValidatorMetrics { validator_id, participation, blocks_produced }
ForkStats { block_number, fork_count }
```

* **Exposed endpoints:**

  * Prometheus metrics, optional Grafana dashboards.

## **3. Off-Chain Worker (OCW) Architecture**

```
+---------------------------+
| OCW Scheduler             |
| - Poll Job Registry       |
| - Check dependencies      |
+---------------------------+
            |
            v
+---------------------------+
| Job Executor              |
| - Execute computation     |
| - Track resource usage    |
+---------------------------+
            |
            v
+---------------------------+
| Proof Generator           |
| - Sign result             |
| - Generate Merkle proof   |
+---------------------------+
            |
            v
+---------------------------+
| Submit Proof to JobVerifier|
+---------------------------+
```

**Features:**

* Schedule jobs with dependency handling.
* Track execution times, resource usage.
* Submit verifiable proofs.
* Optional: trigger dependent jobs or XCMP/XCM messages.

---

## **4. Consensus Switching Flow**

1. Admin/Governance triggers `set_consensus(consensus_type)`.
2. Runtime applies changes safely at block boundary.
3. Metrics collected per block:

   * Block time
   * Forks
   * Validator participation
4. Telemetry pallet records metrics.
5. OCWs continue execution aware of block progression.

---

## **5. Cross-Chain Layer (Optional)**

* **XCMP/XCM** for sending/receiving events across parachains.
* Example:

```text
Job A completed on Parachain1 --> XCMP message --> triggers Job B on Parachain2
```

* Event Hub validates proofs before triggering OCWs.

---

## **6. Data Flow Summary**

1. **Job Submission:** Dev submits job via Job Registry.
2. **Job Execution:** OCWs poll Job Registry → execute jobs → generate proof.
3. **Verification:** Job Verifier validates proof → updates job status.
4. **Telemetry:** Metrics collected for job execution, consensus, validators, forks.
5. **Optional XCMP:** Cross-chain triggers for dependent jobs.

---

## **7. Storage & Runtime Integration**

* **JobRegistryStorage:** Tracks all jobs and their dependencies/status.

* **JobVerifierStorage:** Stores proofs & verification status.

* **ConsensusManagerStorage:** Stores current consensus and metrics per block.

* **EventHubStorage:** Maps events to triggers.

* **TelemetryStorage:** Aggregates metrics for observability.

* Runtime hooks:

  * `on_initialize` → schedule OCWs, check consensus changes.
  * `on_finalize` → record telemetry, finalize job/consensus metrics.

---

## **8. Free-First Development Approach**

1. **Local Prototype:**

   * Substrate + Cumulus template → Relay chain + 2–3 collators + OCWs.

2. **Testnet Deployment:**

   * Westend/Paseo testnet → deploy parachain, submit jobs, switch consensus.

3. **Telemetry:**

   * Self-host Prometheus + Grafana.

4. **Cross-Chain:**

   * Local parachains → XCMP messages for dependent job triggers.

✅ **This is a full blueprint for implementation**: every pallet, storage, extrinsic, OCW workflow, telemetry, consensus switching, and optional cross-chain handling is specified.
